API Testing Assignment
APIs that you will be testing will be from github. URL. The APIs will be tested using
Postman, REST Assured and Cypress.
Common Steps:
1. Open the given URL on a browser.
2. Search and open a specific request in the given link from the list of requests
given below.
3. Identify the API method, URL (endpoint) and the body.
Steps on POSTMAN:
1. Paste the endpoint in the URL field.
2. Identify and select the method of the API.
3. Copy and paste the body of the API on the respective field.
4. Execute the API and record the status code of it.
5. Capture screenshot of the Postman window post execution.
Implement the Data Driven Concept using Postman and run with multiple Data
wherever applicable.
Steps on REST ASSURED:
1. In the IDE, declare all the required dependencies in the pom.xml file.
2. Add the URL, body and method in the class.
3. Execute the code for testing the API and record the status code of it.
4. Record the output and log it.
Note: Have to Perform all this using Rest Assured Framework and
Cucumber in Rest Assured Framework. Have to generate the Reports
using Extent Report.
Steps on Cypress:
1. Add the URL, body and method in the class.
2. Execute the code for testing the API and record the status code of it.
3. Record the output and log it.
Implement all the above steps in Normal Flow of Cypress and By
implementing Cucumber in Cypress.
Note: Try Generating Report using Cypress, you are free to implement
New concepts while doing Project.
List of requests to be validated:
1. CREATE A REPOSITORY FOR A AUTHENTICATED USER
2. UPDATE A REPOSITORY
3. DELETE A REPOSITORY
4. GET A REPOSITORY
5. CREATE A FORK
6. LIST FORKS
7. LIST REPOSITORIES FOR A USER

16.DELETE FROM AN AUTOLINK REFERENCE FOR A REPOSITORY
17.GET A REPOSITORY
18.REPLACE ALL REPOSITORY TOPICS
Instruction for the teams:
1. Each team will have to validate all API requests on all 3 tools
2. Modify or edit the request body as per your team name or requirements for it
to work (like team name, repo name, etc whichever is given in CAPS)
3. Rest Assured and Cypress will be implemented with both normal approach
and with cucumber framework.
4. The submission of the assignment will be a consolidated report containing the
information of all the executions done (with specific tools/ technology)
